                                <p>
                                    The white tank top began life in the 1910s, a garment men could wear underneath dress shirts and while swimming. Within a few decades, men were eschewing their button-downs and opting to wear the tank top on its own – a fashion evolution similar to their sartorial second cousin, the storied T-shirt.
                                    
                                    Nowadays, the tank top is a wardrobe essential that functions both as a layering piece and a stand-alone – popular with any gender. The style was all over fall 2022 runways: Prada sent models wearing tanks embellished with its logo, Bottega Veneta created leather versions of the ribbed white top and Acne paired white tanks with oversized pants.

                                <p>
                                    Prada is one of the most iconic brands in fashion history. The designers behind the brand have continually striven to be innovative while maintaining their classically refined style. The House of Prada has proven its longevity, and the Prada name will still be in demand for years to come. Here is the history of Prada and the famous name. Prada expanded its network of directly-owned stores into markets all over the world. The stores were known for their clean aesthetic as well as the unique green hue the walls were painted. The color became known as “Prada Green.” The first “green store” opened in Milan in Via della Spiga. Boutiques in London, Madrid, Tokyo, Paris, and Tokyo followed.

                                <h3>Bringing Floral Back</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Year after year, floral prints continue to be a staple for spring fashion, but have you ever wondered where this popular motif came from? The history of floral prints in fashion stretches back hundreds of years, but manufacturing innovations in the 20th century helped to skyrocket flowery patterns into mass-market popularity, bringing you the beautiful, unique designs you see today.

                                <p>
                                    The little black dress may have been introduced by Coco Chanel, but it was Audrey Hepburn who made the garment famous in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. From Hepburn's Givenchy sheath to Queen Bey's Topshop embellished mini, the LBD has become the uniform of choice for some of the most iconic women in history. However, styles have evolved over the years. Here, we've chronicled the closet staple from the 1920s to now, proving its timeless appeal.

                                <h3>Vests Then and Now</h3>
                                <p>
                                    This fall, we’re nominating the suit vest as the must-have wardrobe staple; no sleeves? No problem! Once a classic menswear garment, the best suit vests for women are reimagined in chic, flattering silhouettes that add a depth of formality to any outfit. With our post-summer return to office on the horizon, making room for a versatile rotation of separates, like the vest, is a fool-proof method for getting dressed in the morning. With much less commitment than a full three-piece suit, the combination of a suit vest and a matching trouser means business.

                                    When boots season comes around each year, nothing is more important than making sure you have the perfect pair of black boots. Any outfit—casual, dressed up, cozy, evening—can benefit from the staple shoe of your closet, whether you prefer a low ankle boot or a high knee boot.

                                <p>
                                    '90s style can be divided into two very distinct aesthetics. The first centres around butterfly clips, tie-dye T-shirts and bedazzled denim while the other is more minimalistic—the sort championed by Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and Jennifer Aniston, which focused on cleaner lines, sleeker silhouettes, and a generally muted colour palette. Right now, the style set is incorporating this specific iteration of '90s fashion back into their wardrobes and, unlike the often polarising Y2K trends that keep cropping up, this is a style throwback I'm very much here for.

                                    This season there are over 100 brands on the official schedule, including Area, Tommy Hilfiger and Tom Ford, making their way back to the coveted calendar. Italian labels such as Fendi and Marni hopped across the pond to jump in on all the action.
