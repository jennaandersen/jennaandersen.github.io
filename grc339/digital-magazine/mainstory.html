                            <h2>Modern White Tank</h2>
                    
          <p>The concept of a capsule closet — a wardrobe made up of a versatile collection of basics like black T-shirts, white button-downs, and little black dresses — is nothing new in fashion. But this year, a new wardrobe essential is leading the pack and, in the process, turning from a trusty staple to a fashion summer must-have: the white tank top. In one of the most talked-about fall 2022 runway moments, Prada showed an assortment of white tank tops embellished with the house’s triangle logo on models like Kaia Gerber and Hunter Schafer. Then, there was Bottega Veneta, which transformed the ribbed white tank top into leather versions, and Acne, which gave the sleeveless piece the high-fashion treatment with oversized trousers.</p>
                    
                
            <p> Today, you would be hard-pressed to find the Loewe white tank top from the spring 2022 collection, as the item has quickly become the It top for the season. While the humble tank top has never truly left the fashion trend cycle, amid the return of Y2K fashion and the rise of genderless fashion, the versatile staple is experiencing a centerstage moment. Celebrities like Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Vanessa Hudgens have all been spotted recently wearing white tank tops, paired with '90s-inspired mom jeans and cargo pants; Bella Hadid has styled the basic tank with everything from knitted shrugs to off-the-shoulder tops. “[The white tank top] is so classic. It's timeless,” says Mark-Evan Blackman, assistant professor of fashion design at the Fashion Institute of Technology. “[Today’s] designers have used the item as a backdrop to bring forth their vision in a very contemporary time.”</p>

                                <p>To back up, the first white tank top was designed in the 1910s as a men's undergarment, meant to be worn underneath shirts and while swimming. Between the 1920s and 1940s, the white tank top started to be worn as outerwear during World War I and II, when, according to Blackman, men “got in the habit of wearing undergarments as clothes.” Still, until 1934, the tank top was “never seen in public,” according to Blackman; the first time the article of clothing became visible to the masses — in a scene in It Happened One Night in which actor Clark Gable took off his shirt to reveal a white tank top underneath — “audiences were scandalized, but sales skyrocketed.” </p>

                                <p>Fifteen years later, the white tank top had become a common item in men’s closets, on and off the screen. “Male Hollywood icons, like Marlon Brando and James Dean, were wearing them, and they were being embraced by the public,” he says. (These media depictions also gave rise to the controversial term “wifebeater,” due to the fact that the item was often shown in scenes where men physically abused their wives.)

                                <p>Given the history, Blackman finds designer fashion’s recent interest in the utilitarian piece of white fabric ironic; while you can still find affordable versions of the look in big-box stores, it’s not unusual to find $300 styles in high-end retailers. “People who are wearing them fashionably now are still referencing something that is 70 years old,” he says.

                                <h3>Vests Then and Now</h3>
                                <p>
                                    This fall, we’re nominating the suit vest as the must-have wardrobe staple; no sleeves? No problem! Once a classic menswear garment, the best suit vests for women are reimagined in chic, flattering silhouettes that add a depth of formality to any outfit. With our post-summer return to office on the horizon, making room for a versatile rotation of separates, like the vest, is a fool-proof method for getting dressed in the morning. With much less commitment than a full three-piece suit, the combination of a suit vest and a matching trouser means business.

                                <p>
                                    When boots season comes around each year, nothing is more important than making sure you have the perfect pair of black boots. Any outfit—casual, dressed up, cozy, evening—can benefit from the staple shoe of your closet, whether you prefer a low ankle boot or a high knee boot.

                                <p>
                                    '90s style can be divided into two very distinct aesthetics. The first centres around butterfly clips, tie-dye T-shirts and bedazzled denim while the other is more minimalistic—the sort championed by Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and Jennifer Aniston, which focused on cleaner lines, sleeker silhouettes, and a generally muted colour palette. Right now, the style set is incorporating this specific iteration of '90s fashion back into their wardrobes and, unlike the often polarising Y2K trends that keep cropping up, this is a style throwback I'm very much here for.

                                <p>
                                    The Spring-Summer 2023 New York Fashion Week season is in full swing. As the kick-off to fashion month, New York City is stirring up an excitement that will set the precedent for the other three cities to follow.
                                    This season there are over 100 brands on the official schedule, including Area, Tommy Hilfiger and Tom Ford, making their way back to the coveted calendar. Italian labels such as Fendi and Marni hopped across the pond to jump in on all the action.
